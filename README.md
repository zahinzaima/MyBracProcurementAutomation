What will we do:

* We will be using the POM design pattern here, where we will create web pages and store them in /pages folder,

* write our tests [test cases or test suites] in /tests/test_cases/ folder

* create a .env file and store our required credentials there, just as shown in the .env.example file

* write commonly used methods to interact with in /utils folder

How to run the test:

Run the following command in the Pycharm Terminal for the preferred test run:

    -> To run all tests: pytest

    -> To run a selected test: pytest ./tests/test_cases/your_desired_test_file_name.py
